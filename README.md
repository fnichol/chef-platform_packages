# Description

Installs individual packages via attribute or data bag metadata. If your needs
are complex or there is additonal config, then that should be in a
standalone recipe/cookbook.

The motivating use case is putting packages like *tree* on systems without
cranking out a cookbook for it. Mac OS X users can also use this cookbook with
the [homebrew cookbook][homebrew_cb] to install packages.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on 0.10.2 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu
* debian
* mac_os_x
* suse
* arch

Please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.

## Cookbooks

There are **no* external cookbook dependencies. If you are targetting Mac OS
X, then you should consider using the [homebrew cookbook][homebrew_cb].

# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install platform_packages

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'platform_packages',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-platform_packages.git', :ref => 'v0.4.0'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-platform_packages/v0.4.0

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-platform_packages.git cookbooks/platform_packages
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-platform_packages/tarball/v0.4.0 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-platform_packages-* platform_packages

# Usage

Simply include `recipe[platform_packages]` in your run_list and populate the
`node['platform_packages']['pkgs']` attribute list.

To use `recipe[platform_packages::data_bag]`, include it in your run_list and
have a data bag called `pkgs` with an item name corresponding to your
platform like the following:

    {
      "id"    : "ubuntu",
      "pkgs"  : [
        { "name"    : "tree",
          "action"  : "upgrade"
        },
        { "name"    : "stow" }
      ]
    }

Alternatively, you can override the data bag and item by setting the
`node['platform_packages']['data_bag']` attribute to some like:

    node['platform_packages']['data_bag'] = ['apps', "workstation-mac"]

# Recipes

## default

Processes a list of *pkgs* (which is emtpy by default) to be installed.

Use this recipe when you have a list of packages in
`node['platform_packages']['pkgs']`.

## data_bag

Fetches an list of *pkgs* from a data bag item and appends it to the
`node['platform_packages']['pkgs']` attribute for processing. This recipe then
includes the default recipe, so there is no need to explicitly include
`recipe[platform_packages]`.

Use this recipe when you want data bag driven data in your workflow.

# Attributes

## `pkgs`

An array of package hashes to be installed on the system, all of which need
no configuration. The keys in each hash correspond to the attributes passed to
the [package resource][package]. For example:

    node['platform_packages']['pkgs'] = [
      { 'name'    => 'tree',
        'action'  => 'upgrade'
      },
      { 'name'    => 'stow' }
    ]

The default is an empty Array: `[]`.

## `data_bag`

The data bag and item containing a list of packages to be installed.. This is
used by the `data_bag` recipe. The default is `['pkgs', node['platform']]`.
